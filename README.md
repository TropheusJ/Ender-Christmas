# Ender Christmas
This mod adds a Christmas texture for the ender chest, correcting a wrongdoing done by Mojang in 22w03a. Should work in any version 1.18.1 or newer.

The Christmas texture works the same as vanilla Christmas chest textures, and will be visible only during Christmas.

This mod is client-side only, and not required on servers. It is purely visual and does not change any behavior.
